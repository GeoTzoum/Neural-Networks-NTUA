# Neural-Networks-NTUA

Assignments for Neural Networks class of ECE NTUA 2022-2023

### 1st Assignment - Supervised Learning
The aim of the 1st assignment is the study and optimization of classifiers in two datasets, one from the UCI repository and one from the Kaggle platform.
The training and optimization of the classifiers on the UCI dataset was exclusively with the skicit-learn functions while on the Kaggle dataset we used an optimization library.

### 2nd Assignment - Unsupervised Learning
On the 2nd assignment we made a movie recommendation system from 5,000 movies based on their concept, using a Self-Organizing Map (SOM) and clustering.

### 3rd Assignment - Deep Learning
On the 3rd assignment we extended the [Tensorflow tutorial for Image captioning](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/text/image_captioning) and built a neural network for producing verbal descriptions from images, using a different dataset and doing optimizations.
